# Zino â†” Argus glue service

This is a glue service for integration between
[Argus](https://github.com/Uninett/Argus), the alert aggregation server, and
[Zino](https://github.com/Uninett/zino), the network state monitor provided by
Sikt.

This is still a work in progress and more information will be added here later.
